# DevOps Tools
- Use for code, build, test, package, release, configure, monitor sys and appln.
- So we have series of tools that can be converted to tool chain. **[Blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_toolchain)**
- we need to focus on following:
  - Tool criteria
    - Programmable - invoke from API or call from cmd line.
    - Verifiable - events and metrics are the imp feedback.
    - Well behaved - use for source control, test would verify the behaviour and able to deploy it in automated manner.
