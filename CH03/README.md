# Building Block of DevOps
## `Agile`
  - Manifesto for Agile Software Development was written in 2001 for the software development process
  - Previously there was a use of waterfall model
  - But in Agile we have Sprint based on the interactive plan model
  - But there is no mention of Operations in the manifesto, whereas there is nothing about the last part of the software
