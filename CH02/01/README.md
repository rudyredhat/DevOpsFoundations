# DevOps Culture Problem
1. `IT CROWD`
- There are Developers, Sysadmins, Infosec Professionals, Network admins, Database admins must not have the conflict.
- Like the developers and sysadmins have a wall in between with the code from devlopment to the production, taken care by them individually.
- Developers team are working for:
  - New functionality
  - Making changes
  - Movinf fast
- Operations team are working for:
  - Maintaining stability
  - Controlling change
- This leads to creation of extra `walls` among the teams.

2. `Key Words & Communication skills`
- Blameless postmortems 
  - Do it within 48 hours when cutomer is facing some issue
  - Have a team build a timeline
  - Have a third party run the meeting
 - Run Blameless Postmortems
  - Description of the incident
  - Description of the root cause
  - How the incident was stabilized or fixed
  - Timeline of the events and the action taken
  - How cutomers were affected
  - Remediations and corrections
 - Transparent Uptime
  - if app is down in the world of saas products, there is a huge impact on the users
 - Rules for Postmortem Communication
  - Admit failure
  - Sound like a human
  - Have a communication channel
  - Above all else, be authentic
  `------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
3. `Collaboration & Culture`
- How to build trust?
  - Books
    - **[Crucial Conversations](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/crucial-conversations-tools-talking-when-stakes-high-second-edition-patterson-grenny/9780071775304.html)**
    - **[Effective DevOps](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-devops/9781491926291/)**
    - **[Getting to Yes](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/324551/getting-to-yes-by-roger-fisher-and-william-ury/)**
    - **[How to Say It at Work](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/295083/how-to-say-it-at-work-by-jack-griffin/)**
    - **[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-To-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People/Dale-Carnegie/9781439167342)**
    - **[The No A**hole Rule](https://hbgbestsellers.com/titles/robert-i-sutton-phd/the-no-asshole-rule/9780759518018/)**

    - **[Web Operations](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-operations/9781449377465/)**
  - Diff lang and Diff tech sums upto diff way of thinking
  - Adopt both the lang is quite benefit as per keeping on self
  - Gathering team as a discussion, eg **(HUBOT)[https://hubot.github.com/]**, similar to Slack, IRC. 
`------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
4. `Leaders & Changing Roles`
  - Devs have to check failing builds and deployment after they have checked in their code
  - Willing to go on call for support
  - Ops and QA engg have to change their approach to provide self service platform and guidance, instead of doing for other people
  - eg, **[Chef Op Maturity Model ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k8f4cra4jiff45g/Operations-Maturity-Model.pdf)**
  - In 2016 , there came `The Westrum Model` which is lean management approach, which is related to Power, Rule & Performance Oriented
  - Always have minimum viable process.
  - Management best practices
    - Independent, corss-functional teams (re-organising them)
    - Help people through change
    - Use agile, lean processes
`------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`
5. `Kaizen: Continous Improvement`
  - In DevOps there is a love for Japenese Word
  - Kaizen - a popular devops practice, means change for the better
  - which is lean model of toyota production system
  - Kaizen's Guiding Principles
    - Good processes bring good results
    - Go see for yourself
    - Speak with data and manage the facts
    - Take action to contain and correct root causes
    - Work as a team
    - Kaizen is everybody's buisness
  - `Gemba` - The real place - the locus where things happen
    - Management by walking around
  - Kaizen process is simple and is process Cycle of = `Plan` - `Do` - `Check` - `Act` and then we execute on that = `Problem Finding` - `Display` - `Clear` - `Acknowledge`
  - Five Whys
    - Focus on underlying causes, not symptoms
    - Don't accept answers like "not enough time"
    - Track the forks in your five whys , e.g `Fish-Bone` Diagram can track all these
    - Don't accept human error as a root cause
  - `People don't fail; processes do`
